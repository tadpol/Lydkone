A little synth project playing with analog inputs and outputs.

From the web page:

> This is a combination of wanting to do something with my Christmas present, an Arduino, and something from a dream. I really don’t remember much else from the dream, but there was this musical instrument that stuck. The whole dream had a style that was quite the cross of Riven and Steampunk.

> The Lydkone, this musical instrument, worked by altering the ripples in the flow of æther. (well, the equivalent to æther in this frame, but I’m calling æther just for ease.) These ripples then resonated through pipes, a bit like a pipe organ. There were five keys that each routed to an output pipe, a limit only to the inexperienced player. By moving one’s hand across the input port that gathered æther, the over all amount of æther available could be adjusted, affecting the pitch of all five notes. Still there was never enough æther to drive all five pipes at once; the best a quality Lydkone could drive was three.

> Now while I am pretty sure that the dream-mechanics that drove the instrument don’t exist in this frame of reality, faking it with a synth should be quite straightforward. Which takes us back to the Arduino. So five fixed keys, one variable hand-wavy-thing, and three note or voice output, then wrap it all in a pretty case. And somewhere along the way, learn how to play it. (such fun!)
